# Hotel Recommendation System

## Project Overview

The Hotel Recommendation System is designed to suggest similar hotels based on textual descriptions. Using advanced text preprocessing techniques and TF-IDF vectorization, the system computes cosine similarity to recommend top related hotels, enhancing user experience and engagement.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Efficiently cleans and transforms hotel descriptions using regular expressions and stopwords filtering.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts cleaned text into TF-IDF feature matrices using `TfidfVectorizer`.
- **Cosine Similarity Calculation**: Computes cosine similarity between hotel descriptions to identify and recommend similar hotels.
- **Content-Based Recommendation**: Recommends top related hotels based on textual descriptions.
